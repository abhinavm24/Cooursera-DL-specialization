Learning Objectives
Discuss the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
Explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning
List the major categories of models (CNNs, RNNs, etc.), and when they should be applied
Assess appropriate use cases for deep learning


Deep learning is taking off because we have:
- lots of data for difference bw traditional ML and DL to be visible
- Hardware improvement to process lots of data quickly
- Alogirthmic improvement leading to improved processing capabilities
    - Sigmoid to ReLu
    - Quantization
